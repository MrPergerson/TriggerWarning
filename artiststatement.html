            Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and other social media platforms play
            a significant role in public political debates in the US and around
            the world. Through these platforms, people reach large audiences
            just by posting a message or responding to another. This network
            that we have access to allows us to engage with the political
            discourse no matter who or where we are. Yet perhaps this freedom
            has become too burdensome for the social media corporations. Using
            social media, politicians who are funded and/or influenced by
            special interests have the ability spread misinformation to a
            network of followers. In response to the increasingly polarization
            of the public, platforms tried to limit the power of politicians
            through means of informing or warning users. My question is whether
            these efforts work? Are these just bandages for a deeper problem
            inherit in the design of the platforms? Furthermore, are social
            media platforms in the position to warn and educate the public about
            what politicians are saying? When brought to US senate hearing, the
            CEOs of these giant social media companies always respond the same
            way to questions addressing deep and complicated issues of their
            platforms; Itâ€™s our policy and we should be able to do what ever we
            want.
